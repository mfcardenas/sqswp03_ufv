# User Manual: ISO Quiz App

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to **ISO Quiz App**, an interactive web application designed to test and improve your knowledge of important software quality standards. Through a dynamic quiz, you can test your understanding of standards such as ISO/IEC 25010, ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148, and ISO 9241.

The application uses an artificial intelligence language model (Ollama) to generate unique questions in real-time, offering an ever-new learning experience. Additionally, it features multilingual support (Spanish and English) and a clear, simple interface.

## 2. Main Features

- **Multilingual Support:** Interface and content available in **Spanish** and **English**.
- **Dynamic Question Generation:** Uses an AI model (Ollama) to create questions on the fly, ensuring each quiz is different.
- **Fallback Questions:** If the AI model is unavailable, the application provides predefined questions to ensure a seamless experience.
- **Source Indicator:** Clearly shows whether a question was generated by AI (🤖) or is a fallback question (📚).
- **Instant Feedback:** Receive immediate visual feedback (green for correct, red for incorrect) after answering each question.
- **Loading Indicator:** A visual cue ("Generating question...") informs the user when the application is working.
- **Simple Interface:** A clean, user-friendly design that lets you focus on the content.
- **Detailed Results:** At the end, you will get a summary of your total score.

## 3. Installation and Setup

To run the application on your local machine, follow these steps.

### 3.1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.7 or higher**.
- **Ollama** with a downloaded language model (e.g., `gemma:2b`). You can download it from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com/).
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

### 3.2. Installation Steps

1.  **Download the Project:** Clone or download the repository into a folder of your choice.
2.  **Install Python Dependencies:** Open a terminal or command line in the project folder and run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Ensure Ollama is running:** Start the Ollama application on your system. To verify it's working and you have a model, open another terminal and run:
    ```bash
    ollama list
    ```
    You should see the model you plan to use (e.g., `gemma:2b`) in the list.

### 3.3. Starting the Application

The easiest way to start the application is by using the `run.bat` script. Simply double-click it.

This script will automatically perform the following steps:
1.  Create a Python virtual environment.
2.  Install the necessary dependencies.
3.  Start the application's web server.

Once the server is running, you will see a message in the terminal indicating that the application is available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## 5. Project Structure (Technical Overview)

-   `app.py`: The heart of the application. It's the Flask web server that manages logic, communicates with Ollama, and serves the pages.
-   `mock_ollama.py`: A script to simulate AI model responses, useful for development and testing without relying on Ollama.
-   `run.bat`: A Windows script to facilitate the installation and startup of the application.
-   `templates/index.html`: The single HTML template that contains the structure for all application screens.
-   `static/css/style.css`: Defines the visual appearance, colors, fonts, and responsive design.
-   `static/js/main.js`: Controls all client-side interactivity: changing language, loading questions, validating answers, showing results, and handling loading indicators.
-   `static/js/translations.js`: Contains all text strings in Spanish and English, enabling the multilingual functionality.
-   `definitions.md`: The original user manual in Spanish.
-   `definitions_en.md`: This user manual.

## 6. Common Troubleshooting

-   **The "Generating question..." indicator does not disappear:**
    -   **Cause:** The AI model (Ollama) is not responding or is taking too long.
    -   **Solution:** Ensure the Ollama application is running on your system. Verify that the language model is correctly downloaded and available.

-   **The application shows an error or fails to start:**
    -   **Cause:** Python dependencies are not installed.
    -   **Solution:** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal from the project folder.

-   **Texts appear in Spanish even though I selected English (or vice versa):**
    -   **Cause:** This might be a browser cache issue.
    -   **Solution:** Perform a hard refresh of the page (Ctrl + F5 in most browsers) or clear your browser's
